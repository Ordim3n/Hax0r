Ideas
•	Scan lines shader?
•	Dash with left shift
•	After clearing a room, a random direction opens (left, right, or down)
•	More enemy types
•	Mini boss midway through the game (see top of main.lua for mid bosses)
•	14 rooms
•	To destroy enemies use left mouse to shoot

•	Have Polybius sprite his OC for the player sprite
•	4 directional angles
•	Needed animations: | idle | walk | run | jump | fall | wall cling | duck |
•	angles: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 7pi/4
