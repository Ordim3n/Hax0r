==Hax0r Storyline==

Room 1:
"User" is fiddling with the network connection cables and eventually connects to the remote PC.
The virus is then uploaded and placed into the world.
"User" notices it's an old PC95 machine which is old as heck, but he sticks with the idea.
Introduce basic movement controls to the player.
After a bit, the "User" decrypts the firewall blocking access to the C:\ drive.

Room 2:
"User" curses and explains that there's going to be interference.
The interference is just the data, and the goal is to overall infect the machine.
The problem, however, is the data if not handled properly will damage you.
In order for the data to be handled properly, infection should be handled by stomping the files.
"User" leaves the virus alone to do its job.

Room 5:
"This is quite the data haul I--you seem to have here."
"Of course, this is only a fraction of the whole disk space."
"Don't give me that look. I built you from scratch!"
"You'll keep going and do as I have requested!"

Room 7:
> freezeplayer
"Look, I'm sorry about earlier. I got carried away."
"Let's just put that past us and things will be better."
"So, do you want to hear about what I did today?"
"Well, I made another script. I'll upload it now."
> unfreezeplayer
"It was a missing component I forgot to upload with you."
"Just don't stand there doing nothing, you useless pointer."
